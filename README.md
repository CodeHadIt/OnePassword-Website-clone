/*I initially wanted to build it using tailwind css, however i wanted to test my vanilla CSS strength on such a complex homepage*/

On first glance one would think the most challenging ascpect of this page will be getting the curved shape on the hero section right.
Well, I did have a torrid time trying to get it right (eventually settled for slighly different shape). 

However, it was not the most chalenging part of this page. That esteemed honour goes to the different images used on different screen sizes. 

This problem had me scratching my head for hours even after I read the docs on MDN on how to do it because i had the images in a differnet folder rather than on the same level folder as the index.html.
